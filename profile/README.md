## Technologies We Use

We're passionate about these technologies:

- **React/Next:** For everything complex (or not)
- **Docker:** Mainly because Fxx forces us to, but is useful for a variety of purposes.
- **MongoDB:** Why SQL? Who cares lol
- **Typescript:** For things that need structure.
- **Go:** For things that are quick and dirty.
- **Perl:** Because bash scripts are nasty.

## Roadmap

Thing's we're currently working on... jk. What haven't we actually made already? lol. There's aloooot more private repos than public ones, and we're running out of ideas to do.

- A custom built hypervisor based on QMEU, written with love and frustration.
- Auto deployment of VPS services via a control panel built into our website.
- Networking, networking, and more networking. Our ASN never sleeps and neither does our engineers.
- Annnd, whatever we really feel like making... lol
